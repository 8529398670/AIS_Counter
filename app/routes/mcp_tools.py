"""The tools /mcp offers (see app/mcp for the protocol and the rules a tool
follows). A tool is declared with its route, by mcp="tool_name" in the
handler's @route(...), and build_registry makes each one with Tool.for_route:
its arguments are the route's own request type, and it runs the route's own
handler, so the two doors answer the same way and refuse for the same
reasons. A tool that adds to its route's answer (where to send a file's bytes)
names a call that does; those live here and in mcp_tools_accounts.py.

The rule: every route an API key may call has a tool, or an mcp_http reason
in its @route(...) for staying HTTP only. app/tests/test_mcp_parity.py fails
until that holds. What a key may not call -- managing API keys, setting your
own password, PIN or two-factor, the owner's screens, and deleting batches
or folders -- needs a browser session (access=SESSION_ONLY), so it has no
tool either. The AIS tools keep their own hand-written arguments and answers
(app/routes/mcp_tools_ais.py); each stands for its declared route all the
same. A login link a key makes works once and dies within a day
(admin.checked_link_options).

After adding or changing a tool, run scripts/api_docs.sh to rewrite
config/mcp.json and config/api.md; app/tests/test_api_docs.py fails until
they are current.

An app's tools that stand for no route are registered in build_registry,
from a new module in this package (mcp_tools_<feature>.py).
