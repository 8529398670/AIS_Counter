"""The URL map. Every API route is declared beside its handler, in its
module's @route("METHOD /path", ...), and build_routes mounts each one in
MODULES, the most specific path first, behind the guards its declaration
implies:

- Anyone signed in, by a browser session or an API key, is the default.
  role=ADMIN is the admins, and role=OWNER the owner from a browser session;
  everyone else gets the 404 an unknown route gets.
- access=SESSION_ONLY turns an API key away. It guards what a key must not
  reach: minting and managing API keys, your own password, PIN and
  two-factor, other people's files. A key that could do those could turn
  itself into a session or carry off every account's files.
- An admin-scoped key may manage accounts and hand out login and invite links.
  Every link records the key that made it, and revoking or deleting that key
  voids the links it made that can still be used, so revoking a leaked key
  still ends what it could hand out. Who may delete or demote whom is in the
  models.
- access=PUBLIC needs no sign-in: logging in, the UI's text, health.
- A feature that can be switched off while the server runs has a switch in
  FEATURE_GUARDS: its routes answer 404 while it is off, before anything else
  is asked.

The Go template's server/routes/routes_generated.go is the same table, written
by its generator from the same rules. Only the pages a link opens and the
catch-alls are written out here.
